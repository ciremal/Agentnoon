# Agentnoon

This is Eric Lam's submission for the Engineering Role coding test at Agentnoon. Given a CSV file containing people date, a responsive web application lays out a hierarchy of people's reporting lines, allowing nodes to be expanded and collapsed and display each node;s number of descendants and non-leaf descendants. This was created using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS.
